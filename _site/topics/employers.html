<em>This is a 90 day PAID contract!</em>
<em>You need to apply for a security clearance beforehand.</em> If you are interested, please get in touch with them ASAP.
The process of briefing within the Government of Canada (GoC) has begun a gradual shift away from complicated and lengthy descriptions to short and telling visual snapshots (e.g. dashboards, client journey maps, etc.). This trend has affected the Admissibility Branch (a diverse policy branch within IRCC) in that many of the briefing materials either replacing or accompanying notes to senior management are being requested in visual format. As a result, the Admissibility Branch is looking to experiment with a dedicated resource to assist in the creation of visuals to support explanation of complex ideas to senior managers. The resource would be responsible for working with 4 divisions on files ranging from international information-sharing to seamless international travel flow.
The resource is expected to have a background in visual design for print media, and would be expected to create graphics including dashboards, placemats, client journeys, tables, etc.</p>

<p>Please be advised that the selected candidate will be required to undergo a security clearance as soon as possible.</p>
